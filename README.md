# Data Analytics Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Description

This project is dedicated to performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions. Through a structured process of data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, this project aims to provide insights that guide further analysis or predictive modeling.

### Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data formats to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Provides a summary of key statistics, including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, for initial data understanding.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilizes a variety of charts, such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to visualize distributions and relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between variables using correlation matrices and visual heatmaps.
- **Outlier Detection**: Spots outliers and discusses potential impacts on analysis results.

### Motivation and Use Cases

Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, providing essential insights before modeling. This project is useful for data analysts, business analysts, and data scientists who aim to explore datasets effectively, make data-driven decisions, or develop initial hypotheses based on the pattens in data.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries to create compelling and informative visuals.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running EDA steps and sharing insights.
